# Cognitive load (from Impeccable)

## Cognitive Load Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these 8 items:

- [ ] **Single focus**: Can the user complete their primary task without distraction from competing elements?
- [ ] **Chunking**: Is information presented in digestible groups (≤4 items per group)?
- [ ] **Grouping**: Are related items visually grouped together (proximity, borders, shared background)?
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: Is it immediately clear what's most important on the screen?
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Can the user focus on a single decision before moving to the next?
- [ ] **Minimal choices**: Are decisions simplified (≤4 visible options at any decision point)?
- [ ] **Working memory**: Does the user need to remember information from a previous screen to act on the current one?
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity revealed only when the user needs it?

**Scoring**: Count the failed items. 0–1 failures = low cognitive load (good). 2–3 = moderate (address soon). 4+ = high cognitive load (critical fix needed).

## The Working Memory Rule

**Humans can hold ≤4 items in working memory at once** (Miller's Law revised by Cowan, 2001).

At any decision point, count the number of distinct options, actions, or pieces of information a user must simultaneously consider:
- **≤4 items**: Within working memory limits, manageable
- **5–7 items**: Pushing the boundary; consider grouping or progressive disclosure
- **8+ items**: Overloaded; users will skip, misclick, or abandon

**Practical applications**:
- Action buttons: 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, group the rest in a menu
- Navigation menus: ≤5 top-level items (group the rest under clear categories)
- Long-form articles: one reading path; gather related links into a single block at the end instead of scattering them mid-flow
- Documentation sidebars: ≤4 sibling choices visible per level before grouping kicks in
- Portfolio and gallery indexes: one decision per screen (which piece to open), not filter, sort, and tag controls all at once
